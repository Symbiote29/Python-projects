Data: Following the publication of the 2005 biography American Prometheus written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, director Sam Mendes had been interested in adapting the book into a film. However, the project never materialized and the authors grew pessimistic about the prospects of the book being adapted to the screen. By 2015, J. David Wargo, who owned the film rights to the book, went through various scripts with the intent of a film adaptation. Wargo later flew to Hollywood and meet James Woods, who had also set up a meeting with Charles Roven, who had previously worked as a producer on various films of Christopher Nolan.[44] In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave the director a book containing Oppenheimer's speeches as a wrap gift. He had felt that as Tenet's main idea was "What if you could un-invent an awful technology? What if the toothpaste could be put back in the tube?", making the film would have been a logical extension and had also been fascinated with the idea of exploring the historical reality of the situation rather than employing it as an analogy in a science fiction context.[45][2]

Data: Oppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris, France on July 11, 2023,[89] followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13,[90] and the American premiere at AMC Loews Lincoln Square in New York City on July 17.[91] Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early,[90] and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere.[91] SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios "duped" the guild into accepting a 12-day-extension for negotiations in order to continue promoting summer films like Oppenheimer.[92] Oppenheimer was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[5][93][94] In addition to standard digital cinemas, it will be also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).[95]
